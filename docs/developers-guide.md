# Developer Guide

This guide explains the contributor workflow for the generated ccnag project.

## Local Workflow

Use `make all` as the public entrypoint for formatting, linting, and tests.
`make lint` runs rustdoc, Clippy, and Whitaker. `make test` prefers
`cargo nextest run` and falls back to `cargo test` when cargo-nextest is not
available. `make check-fmt` verifies Rust formatting with
`cargo fmt --all -- --check`, and `make fmt` formats Rust sources with nightly
`rustfmt` and Markdown with `mdformat`. `make typecheck` type-checks without
building via `cargo check`. `make audit` derives the Rust workspace root with
`cargo metadata`, logs workspace member manifests, and runs `cargo audit` once
from the workspace root. PR CI skips `make audit` and the audit-only setup when
`github.actor` is `dependabot[bot]`; that keeps whole-lockfile advisories from
blocking unrelated Dependabot PRs while human PRs retain the audit gate. The
compensating control is `.github/workflows/audit.yml`, which runs weekly and
can also be triggered manually. `make coverage` uses `cargo llvm-cov` with
`lld`.

GitHub Actions Act validation lives in `.github/workflows/act-validation.yml`.
The main `.github/workflows/ci.yml` workflow deliberately does not run
`make test WITH_ACT=1`; the separate Act workflow runs those slower
container-backed checks in parallel.

A scheduled `.github/workflows/mutation-testing.yml` workflow also runs
`cargo-mutants` via the shared reusable workflow, daily and on manual dispatch.
It is informational and does not gate pull requests. Dependabot keeps its
pinned reusable-workflow SHA current. See the user guide's "Scheduled Mutation
Testing" section for behaviour, and promote surviving mutants into new tests.

## Tooling

### Polonius borrow checker

This project compiles with the Polonius alpha analysis (`-Zpolonius=next`) on
the dated nightly pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`. `.cargo/config.toml`
supplies the flag by default; Makefile recipes and workflows that set
`RUSTFLAGS` must re-state it because the environment value overrides Cargo
configuration. See [the Polonius policy](polonius.md) for the borrow-centric
API and audit-tag conventions.

Generated CI and coverage workflows, plus the release workflow rendered for
applications, pass this base flag through the shared `setup-rust` action's
`rustflags` input. Library renders do not include `release.yml`. The pinned
revision must expose that input, and coverage overrides must repeat the
selected base flag alongside their `lld` linker flag. Contract tests should
assert these inputs and combined flags.

Development builds use Cranelift for debug code generation. On Linux targets,
`.cargo/config.toml` configures clang to link with `mold` so debug builds link
quickly. Coverage generation uses `lld` because LLVM coverage tooling expects
LLVM-compatible linker behaviour.

Install `clang`, `lld`, `mold`, `python3`, and `cargo-audit` before running the
full generated workflow locally on Linux.

## Spelling policy

Markdown uses en-GB-oxendict spelling enforced by the pinned `typos` release.
The tracked `typos.toml` is generated from the estate-wide shared dictionary
and the narrow repository overlay in `typos.local.toml`. Run `make spelling` to
refresh the ignored local shared-base cache when the published source is newer,
regenerate the tracked configuration, and check maintained prose.

### Security audit ignores

Security audit jobs may set `CARGO_AUDIT_IGNORES` for narrowly scoped RustSec
advisories that affect unused or tooling-only dependency paths. Keep each
ignore tied to a documented runtime impact analysis, and remove it when the
affected dependency leaves the graph or the project starts using the advised
runtime path.

## Workflow pins and Dependabot

Dependabot owns the upgrade of GitHub Actions and reusable workflows, including
calls into `leynos/shared-actions`. Contract tests that assert a caller's exact
commit SHA create a lockstep dependency: every time Dependabot opens a bump PR,
the test fails until a human edits the pinned constant to match. That defeats
the purpose of automated dependency updates and turns a routine bump into a
manual chore.

The narrow `RUSTFLAGS_PASSTHROUGH_REVISION` exception applies only while no
independent capability probe can establish that the shared `setup-rust` action
accepts the required `rustflags` input. In that case, assert the first revision
that provides the capability and document this boundary beside the test. Remove
the literal revision assertion once an independent capability probe is
available.

Contract tests may still verify the *shape* of a reusable-workflow caller. They
must not verify the specific SHA value.

- Do assert the workflow references the correct reusable workflow path.
- Do assert the ref is pinned to a full 40-character commit SHA, not a
  mutable branch such as `main` or `rolling`.
- Do assert the expected `on:` triggers, least-privilege `permissions:`, and
  the inputs the caller relies on.
- Do not hard-code the current SHA value as an expected string. Match it with
  a pattern instead.
- Do not fail a test purely because Dependabot bumped the pinned SHA.

```python
import re

SHA_RE = re.compile(r"^[0-9a-f]{40}$")

def test_uses_pinned_full_sha(caller_step):
    ref = caller_step["uses"].split("@")[-1]
    assert SHA_RE.match(ref), f"expected a 40-hex commit SHA, got {ref!r}"
```

If a workflow's behaviour genuinely depends on a feature only present from a
particular commit onwards, express that as a comment or a changelog note, not
as a test assertion on the SHA string. The sole exception is the
`RUSTFLAGS_PASSTHROUGH_REVISION` boundary above: until an independent probe can
confirm that `setup-rust` supports `rustflags`, document and assert the first
capable revision. Remove that literal revision assertion once the probe exists.
